# GoG for Mobile

A little ionic project to build out a mobile app for GoG utilizing the open [api](http://gogapidocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It consists solely of game browsing, as user authentication is another matter entirely and definitely not a responsibility I am willing to undertake without direct permission.

Unfortunately, this will not work on an actual device unless GoG decides to whitelist it. As I am just some random guy, it seems pretty unlikely.
